# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added
- Code blocks render in a box with the language, a copy button and a check result. Every
  block in a finished reply is parsed or compiled on the server (Python, JavaScript,
  TypeScript, shell, JSON, YAML, TOML, XML, Go, C, C++, Ruby, PHP; never run); a failing block
  is sent back to the model for a fix, up to twice, before it is offered for copying.
  `POST /api/code-check` and a Settings → Interface toggle.
- Escape closes the settings, compare and archived windows and the controls panel.
- First-time setup page: a new install asks for your name, email and password and creates the
  admin account; nothing else is reachable until then.
- Change your password under Settings → account (logs out other browsers).
- Login with bcrypt accounts, 30-day sessions and a lockout after 5 wrong passwords.
- Images, audio and video attachments.
- Auto-tags for new chats and clickable follow-up suggestions after each reply.
- `TASK_MODEL` / `TASK_NUM_CTX`: run titles, tags and follow-ups on a local Ollama model.
- Import chats, notes and logins from Open WebUI.
- `GET /api/health` for uptime monitors (no login needed).
- GitHub Actions workflow running the tests, pyflakes and a JavaScript syntax check.
- The Arty look: dark red theme with IBM Plex Sans.

### Changed
- marked, DOMPurify and highlight.js are bundled under `static/vendor/` instead of loaded
  from a CDN, so replies render markdown and highlighted code offline.
- The licence is now proprietary (use only; no copying, modification or redistribution).
- Adding a connection whose URL is already configured is refused instead of duplicating it.

### Fixed
- Replies rendered as raw markdown whenever the CDN was unreachable.
- Light mode kept the dark background behind the chat, hiding reply text.
- On phones the sidebar and controls panel were see-through over the chat, and the sidebar
  stayed open when the window became narrow; settings tabs now scroll in a row.
- Compare view: markdown output, styled column buttons.
- Native file pickers and the compare column buttons were unstyled; preset and workflow name
  placeholders showed stray backslashes.
- Settings, menus, the command palette and the slash menu were see-through over the chat.
- Browsers kept old app files after an update; HTML, JS and CSS are now revalidated on load.
- Helper requests to Qwen3 on Ollama came back empty (they spent the whole budget thinking).
- Docker images could include `.env` and `data/`; they're now excluded by `.dockerignore`.
